# CyberShake CCA Vp/Vs Calculator

The cybershake_find_poisson_average.py script was used to calculate the
Vp/Vs ratio for the CCA model and generate plots as well as CSV files 
documenting those ratios. Ratios that go below 1.5 or above 1.8 are
flagged and plotted as well as written out to the CSV file.

Instructions on how to run the script (and use the output) are included 
in the Python file.

The other scripts are used to find the ratios from the original dataset
and also to find the points with ratio below 1.6.

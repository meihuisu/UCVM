/**
 * @file CHANGES Summary of changes made to cencalvm query software.
 *
 *
 * \section ver080 Version 0.8.0, 2011/05/26
 *
 * @li Updated documentation with availability of elevation query value.
 *
 * \section ver070 Version 0.7.0, 2010/11/18
 *
 * @li Switched from Pyrex/Pyrexembed to SWIG for extension (use as a
 * spatialdatabase).
 *
 * \section ver066 Version 0.6.6, 2010/01/18
 *
 * @li Added missing include directives to fix compilation errors with
 * recent gcc versions.
 *
 * \section ver065 Version 0.6.5, 2008/05/14
 *
 * @li Improved Makefiles so that files are not removed by 'make
 * clean' when the building in the source tree. When building outside
 * the source tree, data files copied from the source tree are removed
 * from the build tree.
 * @li Switched from linking Fortran example query code with C++
 * compiler to linking with Fortran compiler. This appears to fix
 * build problems with the Intel compiler, but may required adding C++
 * libraries to the link line for the Sun compiler (by passing
 * arguments to configure).
 *
 * \section ver064 Version 0.6.4, 2008/04/10
 *
 * @li Fixed bug for finding elevation in extended model (cannot allow
 * use of interior octants). Bug affected squashing as well as queries
 * for elevation of ground surface.
 *
 * \section ver063 Version 0.6.3, 2008/04/02
 *
 * @li Fixed bug for finding elevation in extended model (found flag
 * always false). Bug affected squashing as well as queries for
 * elevation of ground surface. Added sample data files for USGS Bay
 * Area Velocity Model 08.2.0.
 *
 * \section ver062 Version 0.6.2, 2008/04/01
 *
 * @li Fixed bugs related to setting squashing flag in C and C++
 * examples (it was always turned on). Fixed bug in determining
 * elevation using depth from free surface (limited to querying for
 * elevation; squashing was not affected).
 *
 * \section ver061 Version 0.6.1, 2008/03/31
 *
 * @li Added C and Fortran bindings to squash(). 
 *
 * \section ver060 Version 0.6.0, 2008/02/06
 *
 * @li Added ability to query for elevation of topography/bathymetry
 * and squash topography/bathymetry to retain low-velocity material
 * when using the velocity model in models with a flat ground
 * surface. Added extension to the query routines for Python to allow
 * seamless integration into PyLith via CIG's spatialdata
 * software. These new features can be used with any release of the
 * velocity model.
 *
 * \section ver050 Version 0.5.0, 2007/02/21
 *
 * @li Simplified code layout. Condensed multiple libraries into one
 * main library. No changes were made to the API, so the only changes
 * users will need to make is to adjust their linking to simply use
 * "-lcenvalvm".
 *
 * \section ver041 Version 0.4.1, 2006/03/21
 *
 * @li Restructured geometry routines in order to generalize geometry
 * interface. Etree databases with different geometries (different
 * locations) can now use the same query routines. The default
 * geometry is the one for central CA; this can be changed via
 * VMQuery::geometry().
 * @li Improved compliance with C++ standards which eliminated
 * compiler warnings for some compilers.
 * @li Miscellaneous minor improvements in documentation.
 *
 * \section ver040 Version 0.4.0, 2005/11/05
 *
 * @li Restructured query routines, adding the ability to query the
 * regional model, if desired.
 * @li Updated sample input and output data files to be compatible
 * with release 05.1.0 of the USGS Bay Area Velocity Model, including
 * the abilty to use the regional model, if desired.
 * @li Created extension of VMQuery to be compatible with CIG
 * spatialdata package. This will only be of use in CIG code. Building
 * this extension is turned off by default.
 * @li Fixed bug in query routines where projection routine was called
 * twice. Second, superfluous call was removed. This should speed up
 * queries a very slight amount.
 *
 * \section ver030 Version 0.3.0, 2005/10/07
 *
 * @li Changed examples to include FIXEDRES and WAVERES query
 * types. Improved instructions for the examples.
 * @li Turned on averaging of water points but do not allow mixing of
 * averaging of water and solid material points in averaging by giving
 * solid material points precedence (if attempting to mix the two,
 * ignore the water values).
 * @li Fixed FIXEDRES and WAVERES queries so averaged values aren't
 * used when query wants finer resolution than available. For example,
 * if you want values at 200m resolution and a search says only values
 * at 800m are available, then this location is a "void" at 200m
 * resolution so "NODATA" should be returned instead of the values at
 * 800m. Previous versions would return values at the 800m resolution.
 * @li Switched to GNU build system for easier installtion and
 * portability. Users now run configure to generate Makefiles instead
 * of creating them by hand.
 *
 * \section ver022 Version 0.2.2, 2005/08/10
 *
 * @li Fixed bug where inclusion of assert header file was missing in
 * several source files. This resulted in compiler errors in some
 * cases.
 *
 * \section ver021 Version 0.2.1, 2005/08/03
 *
 * @li Fixed bug in creation routine where Vs for water (-999) was
 * scaled. 'No data' values should not be scaled. The query routine
 * was adjusted to undo this scaling, so 'no data' values will now be
 * consistent.
 * @li Fixed bug in MAXRES query routine. Interior octants were
 * returned in search of etree. Now if an interior octant is returned,
 * the values are set to 'no data'. This only occurred when querying
 * the etree at locations above topography and the water surface.
 * @li Added 'no data' and water points to examples for illustration
 * of those cases.
 * @li Added ability to make creation/averaging routines run quietly
 * (no progress reports).
 * @li Fixed bug in cencalvmcquery where filenames were not
 * initialized to empty string. This created filenames from garbage
 * and log files tended to created by default which is not the desired
 * behavior.
 *
 * \section ver020 Version 0.2.0, 2005/07/29
 *
 * @li Added error handler to allow queries to continue even when
 * values cannnot be found for locations. Coordinates of locations
 * where data was not found can be written to a log file. Values for
 * locations not found are set to predefined value (see \link
 * libsrc/query/README libsrc/query/README \endlink for details).
 * @li Fixed bugs in C and C++ examples associated with setting values
 * to be returned in a query.
 * @li Fixed documentation for units of cache size. Units are MB.
 * @li Added average package for creating database with spatial averaging.
 * @li Finished implementing routines and unit testing of queries
 * at fixed resolution or resolution based on wavelength of shear wave.
 *
 * \section ver011 Version 0.1.1, 2005/07/18
 *
 * @li Fixed errors in documentation and updated Make.mm files in examples
 * directory to reflect name of database in release pre1.0.
 *
 * \section ver010 Version 0.1.0, 2005/07/09 
 *
 * original version

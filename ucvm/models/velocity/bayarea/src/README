 * @date 2011/05/26
 * @version 0.8.0
 *
 * @section summary Summary
 *
 * This directory tree contains the software used to create and query
 * the seismic velocity model(s) covering the greater San Francisco
 * Bay area (central California) developed by the United States
 * Geological Survey.
 *
 * @note Updates to the data in the velocity model (the etree database
 * file) are generally independent of updates to the querying
 * software. This means the version numbers are also independent of
 * one another. In other words, unless the velocity model undergoes
 * fundamental changes in the way the data is stored, you can safely
 * use updated versions of the etree database without recompiling the
 * query software, and vice versa.
 *
 * This software was designed with the assumption that users will want
 * to query the velocity model from their own code. As a result, an
 * API is provided for the query routines. Examples of how to use the
 * query routines from C++, C, and Fortran are provided in
 * examples/query with sample input and output in
 * examples/query/data. Any of these examples could be used to get
 * material property values for locations, but performance will be
 * improved if you use the API because the data won't have to be
 * written to and then read from a file.
 *
 * @section installation Installation
 *
 * For installation instructions, see \link INSTALL INSTALL \endlink.
 *
 * @section dirs Directories
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li> \b doc Directory where the documentation for the query API
 * resides. The documentation is available online at
 * http://www.sf06simulation.org/geology/velocitymodel/querydoc/. You
 * can generate the documentation if you have doxygen installed by
 * running 'doxygen doxyconfig' in the doc directory. The routines
 * associated with the user interface are labeled as such in the html
 * documentation.
 *
 * </li>
 *
 * <li> \b libsrc Top-level directory for source files comprising
 * cencalvm library.
 *
 * </li>
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li> \b average
 *
 * The average subpackage is used to populate the interior octants of
 * the etree with averages of the children. In general, it is for
 * internal use only.
 *
 * </li>
 *
 * <li> \b create
 *
 * The create subpackage is used to create the Etree database from
 * Earth Vision files. In general, it is for internal use only.
 * 
 * </li>
 *
 * <li> \b query
 *
 * The query subpackage is used to query the etree database holding
 * the velocity model. See \link libsrc/query/README
 * libsrc/query/README \endlink for additional information on the
 * query routines.
 *
 * </li>
 *
 * <li> \b storage
 *
 * The storage subpackage defines the geometry of the velocity model
 * and performs transformation of geographic coordinates to the Etree
 * ticks. This package is used by the other packages. You should never
 * need to call the routines in this subpackage directly.
 *
 * </li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <li> \b tests Unit testing of all routines.</li>
 *
 * <li> \b applications Source directory for applications (executables).</li>
 *
 * <li> \b examples Source directory for query examples.</li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * @section version Version history
 *
 * For information regarding changes, enhancements, significant bug
 * fixes, etc. see \link CHANGES CHANGES \endlink.

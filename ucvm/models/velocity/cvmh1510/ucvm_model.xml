        <description>
            The SCEC CVM-H velocity model describes seismic P- and S-wave velocities and densities,
            and is comprised of basin structures embedded in tomographic and teleseismic crust and
            upper mantle models. This latest release of the CVM-H (15.1.0) represents the
            integration of various model components, including fully 3D waveform tomographic
            results.

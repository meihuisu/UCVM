CVM-S4.26 (March 2014):

	26th iteration of Po Chen and En-Jui Lee's improvment on CVM-S4 using full
	3D wave tomography. This model also seeks to preserve the CVM-S GTL by 
	including the perturbations when the velocities are higher than 1000m/s.
	Full details on the interpolation scheme are available at:

CVM-S4.23 (November 2013):

	23rd iteration of the full 3D tomography improvement on CVM-S4. This 
	version included the perturbations interpolated on top of the starting
	model that the authors used. The starting model had velocities increased 
	to 1000m/s.

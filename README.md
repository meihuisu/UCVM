# UCVM
The Unified Community Velocity Model (UCVM) software framework is a collection of software tools 
designed to provide standardized access to multiple, alternative, 3D velocity models. 3D velocity models
are used in several types of computational geoscience research including high resolution 3D wave propagation simulations.

To install this prototype, check out from GitHub and run:

python3 setup.py install --user

Requires Python 3.5 at least.

ucvm_run_tests runs all the currently defined tests.

# Find Minimums From Text Model

This is a super simple script that reads in a EL-style text file and
extracts the minimum Vp, Vs, and density from it. It also extracts
the grid point at which the minimums occur. Example text files this 
works with include:

- CVM4SI26_model
- CCAnn.ascii

Where nn is one of the CCA iteration data files.

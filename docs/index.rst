UCVM |version| represents the fifth major release of the Unified Community Velocity Model (UCVM)
framework. UCVM is a collection of software utilities that are designed to make querying velocity
models, building meshes, and visualizing velocity models easier to do through a uniform software
interface. UCVM has been used extensively to generate meshes and e-trees that are then used for
3D wave propagation simulations within California

The UCVM documentation comes with a tutorial and also sections describing the underlying Python
code and implementation.

If you have any questions regarding UCVM, please email
`software@scec.org <mailto:software@scec.org>`_. We will try and respond within two business days.

# This is input file to generate an etree out of CVM models 
# that we expect to be 'good' for 2 Hz 200 m/s simulations.
# It was prepared by Ricardo Taborda for Patrick Small to
# run it using a modified version (by Patrick) of the cvm-
# by-cols program (by Ricardo) with new features for using
# CVM-H model instead of CVM-S.  It will need to be revised
# later to make sure that the layers breakdown is appropriate
# for CVM-S (as we get familiar with the model's depth dis-
# tribution of the velocity structure.
